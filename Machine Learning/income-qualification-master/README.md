<p><strong>Problem Statement Scenario:</strong><br>
Many social programs have a hard time ensuring that the right people are given enough aid. It’s tricky when a program focuses on the poorest segment of the population. This segment of the population can’t provide the necessary income and expense records to prove that they qualify.</p>

<p>In Latin America, a popular method called Proxy Means Test (PMT) uses an algorithm to verify income qualification. With PMT, agencies use a model that considers a family’s observable household attributes like the material of their walls and ceiling or the assets found in their homes to<br>
classify them and predict their level of need.</p>

<p>While this is an improvement, accuracy remains a problem as the region’s population grows and poverty declines.</p>

<p>The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)believes that new methods beyond traditional econometrics, based on a dataset of Costa Rican household characteristics, might help improve PMT’s performance.<br>
<u>Following actions should be performed:</u></p>

<ul>
	<li>Identify the output variable.</li>
	<li>Understand the type of data.</li>
	<li>Check if there are any biases in your dataset.</li>
	<li>Check whether all members of the house have the same poverty level.</li>
	<li>Check if there is a house without a family head.</li>
	<li>Set poverty level of the members and the head of the house within a family.</li>
	<li>Count how many null values are existing in columns.</li>
	<li>Remove null value rows of the target variable.</li>
	<li>Predict the accuracy using random forest classifier.</li>
	<li>Check the accuracy using random forest with cross validation.</li>
</ul>
